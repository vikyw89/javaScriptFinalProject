    <p>Replicate your favorite website as close as possible - Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Just make sure it has lots of interesting functionality. You’ll be integrating a full array of skills into this one. If you have completed a backend course, you may use that for this project, otherwise use Firebase. This should prove that you now have all the tools and knowledge needed to build a website, just like the ones you use every day.</p>
    <p>Of course, you can’t replicate every feature, and the user interface will probably be a bit clunkier. However, if you can get yourself 80% of the way there, that’s darn impressive!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up a GitHub Repo for this project. Follow the instructions in <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/git-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git basics</a> if you need help.</li>
      <li>Think about what you need to do. It’s really helpful to write your plan down on paper or whiteboard ahead of time! A few hours of thought now will save you days of coding. Try to lay it ALL out. An important part of planning is <strong>scope</strong>. You obviously can’t build the entire website (which presumably took a full team of engineers years to produce), so you’ll need to identify the site’s core functionality and the “nice-to-have” stuff. <strong>Make sure you finish the core functionality BEFORE working on the rest.</strong> If you try to do everything at once, you’ll get lost and frustrated. Trust us. Everything takes longer than you expect.</li>
      <li>Roll up your sleeves and start building!</li>
      <li>Try to test the high-level functionality using a suitable testing library, for example, Javascript with Jest or Rails with RSpec. Don’t get too bogged down in testing, but try and save yourself time by adding high-level tests, so you don’t need to click around 100 times every time you make a change to something that seems important.</li>
      <li>Once you finish, push to GitHub and definitely submit your project below!</li>
    </ol>
